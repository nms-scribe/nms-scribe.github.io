TODO: Next:
[ ] Announce the new blog on the old blog and on social media
[ ] Comments - One problem with 'issues' is that I have to create the issue, and if there are never any comments then there's no need for an issue. Not to mention, it requires logging in to Github, doesn't it? I need some way of doing anyonymous comments. How does the blogger stuff do that?

FUTURE: I'm seriously contemplating rewriting this whole thing in a language I know just to get rid of the ruby configuration files and other weirdness such as automatically creating style.css even when I want something else.

# N M Sheldon

I am an amateur (for now) author, role-playing game designer, fantasy cartographer, software developer, husband and father. At least, those are what I think of myself as.

I live in rural eastern Wisconsin, USA, and am a member of my [local writer's group](<https://fdlw.wordpress.com/>). If you wish to contact me, use the options available through the social media links in the menu.

## About This Blog

This blog is dedicated to updating the world about the creative projects Iâ€™m working on, whether it wants to hear them or not. I may also post some articles on random thoughts and happenings.

As is tradition, this blog will probably begin with a burst of posts over the next few months, followed by a gradual decline until it goes ten or twenty years without anything new.
