TODO: Next:
[ ] Comments - One problem with 'issues' is that I have to create the issue, and if there are never any comments then there's no need for an issue. Not to mention, it requires logging in to Github, doesn't it? I need some way of doing anyonymous comments. How does the blogger stuff do that?
    * Okay, here's the plan:
      * Set up a "comments" panel at the bottom of each post, it contains:
        * a button to load disquss with a warning that this loads disquss, which can track you, but it's the only way to comment anonymously (with moderation).
        * a button to click if you don't want to load disquss, which will give you a bunch of other ideas for contacting me, including the social media and the discussion page. Unfortunately, I don't have any other way to handle anonymous comments, but with disquss.
[ ] Custom 404 page?

FUTURE: I'm seriously contemplating rewriting this whole thing in a language I know just to get rid of the ruby configuration files and other weirdness such as automatically creating style.css even when I want something else. A rust-based site builder would be nice, but I need my own templating language.

## About This Blog

This blog is dedicated to updating the world about the creative projects Iâ€™m working on, whether it wants to hear them or not. I may also post some articles on random thoughts and happenings.

As is tradition, this blog will probably begin with a burst of posts over the next few months, followed by a gradual decline until it goes ten or twenty years without anything new.

If you are looking for something specific, see below for a list of categories, or a list of series. Or use the search input above to do a text search of all posts and pages.
