## Works in Progress

### The World of Inannak

![A preview map of Inannak. The preview shows a map of a fantasy world in an elliptical projection, surrounded by abstract knot-like artwork and a text-art display of the word "Inannak".](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-12-22/inannak-preview-a5-150-wm.png>)

A fantasy setting designed for almost any game system.

After millennia of oppression under the iron tentacles of the dread gods, the peoples of Inannak have finally banished their masters and freed themselves. But the consequences of this event are still in play. Will other entities invade to fill the vacuum of power? Did the gods have a larger role in protecting the world from doom than their slayers knew?
