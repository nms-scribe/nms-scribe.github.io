Back in February, I posted about an experimental [fantasy world called Inannak](<{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2022-02-04-inannak-portents-of-the-end.html>). I set it aside because I have so many other projects I want to work on. But In a few weeks or months, I plan to bring Inannak back to this blog, and I have ambitious plans.<!--more-->

There isn't much I can get out of a worldbuilding project beyond personal enjoyment. I could use it to develop a setting for fantasy stories or games. But I would argue there are more efficient ways to do that than building a whole separate document. I could sell it as a work on its own, as a fantasy roleplaying setting in a big hardcover book with a shiny cover. But I doubt my chances of making a positive profit off that without the backing of a well-known gaming company.

This makes it hard to justify spending my time, and that makes me feel guilty. Hence, the phrase "guilty hobby".

To rationalize spending time on this project, I've decided to take an idea from open source software, and publish the world of Inannak free online[^1]. The goal is to create a world that anyone may use for their home games, reading enjoyment, and perhaps occasional fan-fiction. Not that I expect it to be popular, but it's better that Inannak run wild than languish in the dark of my computer hard drive.

Another way I will make this world useful is to share my worldbuilding processes and techniques. As I build Inannak, I will describe my methods and thoughts about this world on this blog. My first articles on Inannak will be my recipe for the first world maps. Once there, I will have what I need to develop the world's history, and from there, it's geography and other lore.

I will publish the Inannak book contents free on a website, and you will get to watch it from the beginning as the world emerges. This website will include ways to ask questions, provide suggestions, and discuss the project with others. Perhaps someday I will also sell a physical book, or use it as the setting for a fantasy novel or series.

I'm anxious to get started on this project, and excited for you to see it. I wish I could give you a timeline, but my schedule is filling right now, and I don't know how long this will take.

[^1]: I want to make a few caveats here: Inannak won't be public domain. I reserve a bunch of rights, including any rights to profit off of it or derivative works.
