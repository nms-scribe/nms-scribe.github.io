[![A map of a small, rural village entitled "Arenthorp"](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-04-07/arenthorp.png>)](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-04-07/arenthorp.png>)

It's been a while, so I thought I'd publish a map I put together for an adventure I'm working on.<!--more-->

Arenthorp sits in the Ward of Lakferd, which has forty square miles of wilderness and a few other small hamlets. It is a relatively peaceful countryside. There are generally no tales of things more dangerous than a wild animal. This ward is part of the Shire of Mersende, which is a large town of about 600 people, fifteen miles from Arenthorp on the Cuckoo Shireway.
