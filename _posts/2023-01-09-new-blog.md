I've decided to move to a new blog site.<!--more-->

Wordpress works fine, but I was hitting some walls that made it harder to write. The number one problem was how sluggish the editor was when I was writing longer posts, especially when adding pictures. I wanted to be able to write off-line, store my drafts on my machine, and upload them when they were ready. I wanted to be able to customize my theme easily, and automate a couple of publishing tasks. With wordpress, all these wants would require me to pay them more, or find a different host.

So I've moved to Github Pages, using the Jekyll static site builder. It takes more work to configure, but I have a lot more control over it. The number one benefit is that it is a lot easier for me to write and publish on here. I might even be able to hook up grammar and spell checking.

The only issue right now is that there is no way to comment on posts. Considering the number of comments I get on any of my posts, I don't think that will be a problem for a while. But I'm working on something. In the meantime, if you have any comments, suggestions, or whatever, you can reach me on the social media links at the top of this page. (*NOTE: I've since added commenting through discuss. For more information, see the bottom of this post and the [notes about it on the home page](<{{ '#on-commenting' | relative_url }}>).*) 

Since part of this transformation involves adding a script to process images before they post to the blog, I'm including an image in this blog. The image below is an interesting part of [Inannak](<series/Inannak>).
