One of my creative paths is fantasy cartography. Here's a work in progress.<!--more-->

A few weeks ago I discovered that data from the Magellan spacecraft's survey of Venus is available from the [USGS](<https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/>). For years, I've been seeking ways to make "realistic" fantasy worlds. Randomly generated terrain just doesn't cut it, and I thought that the real terrain models we have are limited to one planet which most people are already quite familiar with.

When I saw the elevation data from Venus, which is remarkably free of craters, and about 90% complete, I knew I had found something I could use. After a bit of data fiddling and amateur climatology, I came up with the above map.

This is not a representation of a terraformed Venus. It's a fantasy world derived from Venus. The name comes from the Sumerian goddess associated with the planet. That name, what we can guess of the planet's history, and a world-building idea I spotted somewhere on a forgotten tweet, led to the scenario in the caption.

This is the first draft, and I expect the final world will not look like this, as I have other ideas of how to make this more imaginary. But I have other things I need to work on for now. I hope I can return to this later.
