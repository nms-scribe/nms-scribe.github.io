I've just put another little thing up on DM's Guild: a set of [minimalist character sheets](<https://www.dmsguild.com/product/383787/Minimalist-Character-Sheets?src=blog>).<!--more-->

When I got back into D&D, I wanted to give my players character sheets to work with. However, I was disappointed with almost everything I found, especially the sheets provided with the Player's Handbook. At first I just went with the flow. But after some time looking at these things and watching my players try to use them, I gave up and designed my own.

I originally posted these on Reddit about a year ago, but now that I have space on the DM's Guild, I decided to put them here.

These sheets put everything that a player needs to look up quickly on the front page: stats, attacks, skills, proficiencies, and special features. I'm especially proud of the amount of space I've made available for that last part. Fifth Edition loves its racial and class features, but the official character sheets only set aside about 1/6th of the page area as a place where players can write those down.

I also tried to make the sheet simple and clean, making use of negative space instead of filling it with extra decorations seen on other character sheets. The little dragon tail wrapping around the name on the official sheet looks cool, but my player's need room to write.

If you want to take a look at them, perhaps use them in your own tabletop games, they're available for free.
